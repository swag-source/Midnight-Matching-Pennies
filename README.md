# 🪙 Midnight Matching Pennies
A privacy-focused implementation of the Matching Pennies exercise based on Compact Smart Contract development language.

# 🎯 Overview
This exercise tackles the challenge of implementing a simultaneous-commitment game on blockchain, where traditional transparency conflicts with the need for private decision-making. The game consists of two players picking a coin side and once both players have commited to the choice, later revealing if their decisions match or differ.

# 🔐 The Challenge
Despite the easy game explanation, due to the blockchain's nature of transparecy, the programmer faces with the architectural & algorithmic challenges of maintaining private information for the correct game development, while leveraging the language provided tools to achieve the task.
